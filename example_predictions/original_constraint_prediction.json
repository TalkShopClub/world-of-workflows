The user\u2019s previous group membership (clearance 3) had been removed in action_index 8.  Because the asset ASSET_140 requires clearance 3 (u_clearance = 3), lowering the user\u2019s clearance to 2 forces the platform to un-assign the asset from the user.  This is evident in the audit record within action_index 9: fieldname \"assigned_to\" on alm_hardware is changed from the user\u2019s sys_id to \"\" (blank).\n\nThus the user transfer carried out in action_index 9 directly causes the user to lose clearance and surrender an assigned asset, which is disallowed by organizational Policy-6.
